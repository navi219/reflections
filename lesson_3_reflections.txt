When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Collaborating with others or working from multiple workstations. Also provides effective offsite backup.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If others are updating the repository as well, you don't want your local work overwritten, or even just changing unpredictably.
